    <h2>05-11 - Monday</h2>
<p>Hey Hunny,</p>

<p>You and I are together for 3 months! I really feel lucky to have met you and may you call my girl these 3 months, the time really has flew by us. In the past three months we have connected in such incredible way I have not experienced it before with anyone else, the time we spend togehter feels to slips through my fingers everytime again and again.</p>

<p>I wish there was a way to slow the time down whenever we are toghether!</p>

<p>You make me feel like I won the lottery, and I keep saying this over and over again Like I am stuck in a loop. But perhaps that is more the lack of the laguage we use as humans. The shortage of words to express my love for you.</p>

<p>In the next few months we will spend more time together, and I really cant wait. But also this short time will be over before we know it. We must make the most of it by doing as much toghether as we can! Dont worry you can still have your me time :) just let me know and I shall leave you be. Better yet I might even just let you be we will see if I can learn when you want this without you telling me.</p>

<p>Either way I feel we can only come out stronger with each passing month as there is always something to learn about you! each and every hug feels special and ment, and your smile really makes me skip a beat with this stunning eyes that captured my soul and heart from day one.</p>

<p>I will love you always &lt;3!</p>
