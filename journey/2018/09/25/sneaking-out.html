    <h3>19-09 - Den Hauge</h3>
<p>This evening was quite something, we went on our first date night! Its a fun thing to do with you so the weekends will get a different purpose and this
will be extra special moments not to forget, As you shall soon be read. We started of  with watching a movie in the pathe in Den Hauge it was called ‘Johny English strikes again’
After which we went to the city to get something to eat. After much deliberation and choiche stress we settled for Havannah.</p>

<p>Quite a nice place for a bin of nachos and some drinks before it turns into a night club, where you dont really want to go to!
Here is where it got interesting, I still had to go home but it was getting quite late! So we walked to your home where you invited me in. In hindsight very sweet but not very practical
as you are not allowed to have visitors to stay over (well manly ones atleast) We settled upon some rest for the both of us which resulted in us waking up at 5 to sneak me out of the house
in order to drive home!</p>

<h3>23-09/25-9 - Barneveld</h3>
<p>The rest of the weekend went on quite normally, You stayed over till tueseday morning which was quite a nice change actually.
