<p>Here it is our first complete weekend together! We did not do much, But we did get to know eachother more intimatly. With this our daily routins that we have.
You also saw my parents for the first time, But not yet my sister she was working. After all of this I brought you home on a 2.5 hour drive the scenic route just
to spend more time with you. We then had ramen in China town!</p>

<h3>05-09 - Barneveld</h3>
<p>This is the date of our first month together, Unfortunatly this fell on a wednesday but we will celebrate this later in the weekend.</p>

<h3>07-09/09-09 - Barneveld</h3>
<p>The weekend of our first mont aniversairy, It did not go completly smooth but we are still getting used to one another.
We went for a lovely dinner here in Barneveld at the Hebbert not a special place but it was nice enough. Next time I will have to up the game on this!
Any how we went home, had wine and went to bed and woke up super late!</p>

<p>Other than that you worked, I did my laundryand other stuff and in the evening we watched a movie! The following sunday was a bit rough but in the end we had a great day!
We had coffee, ice cream rolls, kimci and i dropped you off at home, Still not getting used to it.</p>
