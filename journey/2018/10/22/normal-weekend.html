    <h3>19-10 - Firday</h3>

<p>Hey Cutie, It has been a while since you came to my place on a friday. Never the less I enjoyed our date night eventhough my driving on the bike was rough.
Again I will prommise you yo change that as I want to be around you longer, Hopefully youll be in the back once more I really do enjoy it.
Either way our trip to body worlds was great it was interesting and you seemed to have fun aswell. Our dinner well it was food lets keep it a that. For a place at the Dam in Amsterdam
you would think it would turn out a bit better than it did. At home we almost went straight to bed as we were quite tired.</p>

<p>I am sorry for upsetting you though, the last thing I want to do is to hurt you in any way.</p>

<h3>20-10 - Saturday</h3>

<p>We woke up late, as leaving the bed was quite hard to do with all the cuddles that we had. But eventually we did and after we had quick breakfast, and you called your mom we went out for a run!
Even though we did split up because of our speed difference I still had a super great time with you, we did even run 6.51K not too bad at all! quite happy with it.</p>

<p>From here it was time for lunch and we started our wall map project, we made it half way through the map before we decided on dinner with wine.
Now the hard part but also the most beautifull part of the weekend, We shared so much of our selfs we grew so much closer, And again you will be safe with me for as long as we are together.
There is nothing I would not do to keep you safe. But then I also realize you are a tough cookie so I will have to balance it out, And manage my self not to be too much..</p>

<p>I am sure we will find our way together as we have done many times now, Even with the map we seemed to work together pritty well as we seem to do in the kitchen too.
Time for a movie then a netflix origional “beirut” we did not finish it as you fell asleep while I was laying against you feeling so close and content with us. quite a magical moment.</p>

<p>In bed we talked some more before we fell asleep with more cuddles. It is seriously something I cant get enough of your warm hug your comfort and smile afterwards as you lean your head
back resting it on my arms for support so I can kiss you all over your face. These little moments that we share are the ones that stick the most.
The best thing you said this day: “We just have to marry before I leave” It wont solve the problem but it shows how much you love me.</p>

<h3>21-10 - Sunday</h3>

<p>This sunday we woke up at a reasonable time with cuddles, you inmediatly wanted to go work. You must have worked for atleast 3 hours while I was at my parents too in the mean time.
They were expecting you actually, But doesnt matter we discussed a lot also about us, upcomming christmas, the birthday party of Lex, the mess at my moms place I have to clear up with them
And many more things. Once home you were still busy working so I let you to it. After your work we went on an got back to our project. it is now hanging complete at the wall.
Time for our travell pictures I will make those this week somewhere. We finished up beirut afterwards then time for dinner some chillaxing with netflix and it wass off to bed again.</p>

<h3>22-10 - Monday</h3>

<p>Today, my first day of a week where i yet have to get all my plans for I am having a few das off between jobs. Next monday I will start in Amsterdam, thanks to you I made this happen.
I am really gratefull, it really is a good step forward. I hope soon you will manage to do the same I am really supporting you like a cheerleader even though I seem to have put a selfish request
at your end. This morning I had to drop you off at the station again. And somehow you packing your stuff on a sunday and leaving on a monday still is not something I am used to. And I secretly hope
I never will aswell rather have you stay, but I know that day will come sooner or later the day we have our own first place thogether. Lets see how we manage our 3 weeks sleep over in December,
how our routine will come together. If our cooking, and our project is anything to go by it is that we can work together, so we should be able to work it out together.</p>
