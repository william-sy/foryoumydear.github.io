    <h3>25-07 - Tinder!</h3>
<p>This is our beginning not very glamerous, or a funny story but as most people these days we met on the internet. The dating app tinder was our choice.
For me it started with seeing your profile, after reading it I super liked you. From here the waiting started to see if you would like me too.
Why I liked you, well your photos, and the ‚Äúnot quite the typical üòâ‚Äù helped together with as you now know my thing for asians.</p>

<p>You swiped on the other hand as you have told me because of my motor cycle (not mainly but it gave the final say)! Either way I am not complaining about it.</p>

<h3>28-07 - The day we should have met</h3>
<p>Yeah I know, I should have met you this day. If i knew what I know today that you would steal my heart so quickly as you did later on. Unfortunatly we both had plans
And by the time I was done after a hactic day, it was 23:00. My chanche gone and you in bed.</p>

<h3>29-07 - Our first date?</h3>
<p>Well I managed to meet you a day later and seriously I am not regretting doing this. Our intention was to meet as frieds to build a great friendship, Secretly I was also open for more.
I just had to meet you, our conversations were so interesting and captivating. you sounded non typical indeed.</p>

<p>And so we did around 15:30, well that was the plan you were late ;), But it now seems that it was also a bit my fault for parking at the wrong store.
Either way all was forgiven the moment I saw your face with a huge smile bouncing over the crossing. We hugged and we go t you situated on the bike for our ride to the beach!</p>

<p>Once we were at Scheveningen, we walked up the pier, the beach and onto a port for the life guards. Here we sat down at the end of the strorm breaker for quite a while.
We talked (well mostly I did) about lots of things, so much so it was time for dinner.</p>

<p><a class="example-image-link" href="/assets/images/tinder2907.jpg" data-lightbox="tinder" data-title="We sat here quite a while."><img class="our-map" src="/assets/images/tinder2907.jpg" alt="Tinder" /></a></p>

<p>We got Indonesian food, probably because we talked about it in one shape or form, Not sure how that happend any longer. But here I sat across you the first time i propperly got to take a look at you.
Ad boy did I fell in love with those brown eyes, Problem was we were there for friendsip! After some staring some more talking I got you home after we got lost. And we talked even more at your kichen table before I had to go home. The day after was just a normal working day.</p>

<p>We hugged and boy that felt so great.</p>

<h3>30-07 - Date 2?</h3>
<p>During the day we started chatting over whats app after we exchanged numbers (still dont have your dutch one!) I managed to get myself another date with you after you asked me what my plans were for the evening.
I said I was going to drive around on my bike, You askes for how long my rides usually lasted. I bluffed and said an hour or 2, In the end that somehow made me end up at your kichen table once more.</p>

<p>This evening we talked again like we have never met before, for hours on end until yet again it would be wise for me to leave because of work the next day. But not before I confessed I started to
like you more than a friend. You very carefully said you liked me back, and so we hugged goodbye once more.</p>
