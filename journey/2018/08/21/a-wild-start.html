    <h3>16-08 - Your kitchen (again)</h3>
<p>It seems to be a trend to be at your kitchen, but not too worry it will all change soon! This is the start of a few days where we will see eachother before you go to France on a mini vacation on your own.</p>

<p>On this day we cuddled, cooked, and talked some more! We made plans to go on vacation together in December which is a big thing to do within our first month. But I am glad we did.
It really gives me a point to look forward to. Also as wierd as my mind is it seems like for aslong as you dont cancell that we are great, This first weeks have been full of insecurities about echother.
But we should let them be and focus on the more positive side of things. When will this vacation be? well we both have different go dates our vacation planning will as follows:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>- 21</td>
      <td>&nbsp;December</td>
      <td>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</td>
      <td> You fly to Malaysia</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>- 26</td>
      <td>&nbsp;December</td>
      <td>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</td>
      <td>I fly to Hong kong</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>- 28</td>
      <td>&nbsp;December</td>
      <td>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</td>
      <td>Quick day trip to Maccau for me</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>- 31</td>
      <td>&nbsp;December</td>
      <td>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</td>
      <td>I fly to Malaysia to be with you once more after <b>9</b> days of not seeing you</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>- 5</td>
      <td>&nbsp;January</td>
      <td>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</td>
      <td>We will fly home together</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
